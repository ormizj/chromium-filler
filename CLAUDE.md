# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm test                 # Vitest watch (unit + integration)
npm run test:run         # Vitest once (CI-style)
npx vitest run src/shared/matcher.test.ts   # single test file
npx vitest run -t "dedupe"                   # single test by name
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit
npm run build            # tsc --noEmit && vite build -> dist/
npm run dev              # Vite dev server + HMR
npm run test:e2e         # Playwright; requires `npm run build` first
```

### UI validation

`.mcp.json` registers the Playwright MCP server with `--caps=vision`, for driving
a real browser and inspecting rendered UI from a screenshot rather than from the
DOM. It is the tool of choice for checking the responsive surfaces — the modal,
the setup panel, and the options queue at phone width — because most of what can
go wrong there (a crushed row, an off-centre grip, an unreachable control) is
invisible to a DOM assertion. New MCP servers load on Claude Code restart.

For UI work also start `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:5173/dev/`, which
renders the real popup and options against a mocked `chrome.*` — including a
**390px phone frame** beside the desktop one, so the mobile-first layout is what
you iterate on rather than an afterthought.

E2E loads the built extension into real Chromium (`npx playwright install chromium`
once). Always `npm run build` before `npm run test:e2e` — the suite loads `dist/`.

## Architecture

MV3 Chrome extension that auto-fills job-application forms. It **never submits** —
the user presses the site's own Send button. Filling is automatic but **never
silent**: a Shadow-DOM review modal reports every field as filled (green) /
low-confidence (yellow) / unmatched (red).

Three runtime contexts, all sharing `src/shared` (which holds every piece of
pure, unit-tested logic):

- **`src/content`** — the per-page orchestrator (`main.ts` `Controller`). On a
  matching page: wait for slow form (`waitForForm.ts`) → run prep steps
  (`prep.ts`) → classify the posting (`redirectDetect.ts`) → **either** hand off
  to the external application **or** extract job title/description
  (`extract.ts`) → detect fields (`fieldDetect.ts`) → fill high-confidence only,
  incl. CV via DataTransfer (`fill.ts`) → show modal (`modal/`).
  `picker.ts` = click/tap-to-pick override.
- **`src/background/service_worker.ts`** — opens options, handles the `SUBMITTED`
  message (mark URL applied + optional tab close), and owns the two-step redirect
  watcher (below). `session.ts` owns the queue session (below).
- **`src/popup`, `src/options`** — popup triggers run/reset and shows session
  progress; options is four tabs (Queue · Profile · Settings · Sites) managing
  the job queue, profile, CV, behavior settings, and site configs.

Cross-context messaging goes through the typed `MSG` contract in
`src/shared/messages.ts` (payloads must be structured-clone friendly).

### UI layer
`src/ui/tokens.css` + `src/ui/primitives.css` are the **only** place colours,
spacing, touch targets, buttons, rows, dots, sheets, and chips are defined. Both
files use a `:root, :host` selector list so one copy serves the light-DOM pages
(which `<link>` them) and the two shadow roots (which inline them via
`src/ui/shadowCss.ts`). Before this existed each surface had a private copy and
they contradicted each other — popup dark mode was literally the inverse of
options dark mode. Add a rule here, not in a surface's own file, if two surfaces
could ever want it.

Mobile is the priority target (Kiwi). `--tap: 44px` under `@media (pointer:
coarse)` is the floor for every control; status is never colour alone (dots carry
a glyph); and the modal/setup sheets become full-width bottom sheets under 640px.

### Data model & storage
`src/shared/types.ts` is the source of truth: `Profile`, `SiteConfig`,
`JobUrlEntry`, `Settings`, `StoredState`. Everything persists in
`chrome.storage.local` via typed wrappers in `storage.ts`. `FieldKey` enumerates
every fillable field (`resume` = the CV file).

`SiteConfig` drives per-site behavior: `urlPatterns` (match-pattern or `/regex/`),
`waitFor`, `prep`, `extract`, `fieldOverrides` (beat the heuristics), `cvUpload`,
`submitCv`, `autoDetect`, `successSelector`.

### Two-step (redirect) postings
A board mixes quick-apply postings with postings that hand off to an employer
ATS, so the branch is **per page, not per site**. `redirectDetect.ts` classifies
(config `redirect.*` selectors first, then a narrow label/cross-origin heuristic
in `src/shared/redirect.ts`); only a confident `redirect` verdict diverts —
`unknown` falls through to the normal fill path, because a false positive
navigates away from a page that could have been filled. A listing page with
several external apply links is deliberately `unknown`.

Following is automatic: `redirect.beforeFollow` steps run first (the board's own
"Save job", forced optional), then `FOLLOW_REDIRECT` hands over to the background,
which watches the tab (and any tab it opens, via `openerTabId`) until the URL
settles past tracker/302 hops, then `linkRedirect`s both ends into the job DB and
pushes `REDIRECT_LANDED` to the destination. Watches live in
`chrome.storage.session` — the worker can die mid-navigation. A destination with
no site config gets one via `ensureConfigForUrl`, so its form fills immediately;
submitting there propagates `applied` up the `sourceUrl` chain
(`applyStatusChain`).

### Queue sessions
`src/shared/queue.ts` (pure) — `nextBatch` picks the waiting URLs that fit the
free slots, `queueProgress` summarizes for the headers. The queue is **derived**
from the job-URL database (status `new`), never copied, so imports and manual
status edits feed it automatically.

`src/background/session.ts` drives it: at most `settings.sessionBatchSize` job
tabs exist at once, and *finishing one opens the next* — `chrome.tabs.onRemoved`,
`SUBMITTED`, and `SESSION_SKIP` all free a slot and top up. Opens are staggered
(`STAGGER_MS`) and serialized through a promise chain, because two events landing
together would otherwise both claim the same slot and open a posting twice.
State splits by lifetime like the redirect watches: `{ active, batchSize }` in
`chrome.storage.local` (survives a restart), tab↔URL map in
`chrome.storage.session` (tab ids don't). Never restore the old behaviour of
opening every URL in one loop — 60 links meant 60 tabs.

### Job-URL database
`src/shared/jobUrls.ts` (pure) — `addUrls` dedupes by URL (the unique key),
`applyStatus` records status transitions with timestamped history
(new → opened → redirected → applied / skipped), `linkRedirect` records a
two-step posting (both ends, cross-linked, never demoting an existing status),
`applyStatusChain` propagates up `sourceUrl`, `jobUrlStats` aggregates for the
dashboard.
`urlImport.ts` extracts/normalizes/dedupes URLs from a pasted text blob.

## Non-obvious constraints (do not regress)

- **Content scripts share the PAGE's origin**, not the extension's — so the CV
  is stored in `chrome.storage.local` (base64, needs `unlimitedStorage`), NOT
  extension IndexedDB. See `cvStore.ts`.
- **`successSelector` must be VISIBLE**, not merely present — sites pre-render
  hidden success nodes. The `MutationObserver` in `main.ts` watches `style`/
  `class`/`hidden` attribute flips. This is the authoritative "actually sent"
  signal; a bare `submit` event is only the fallback for full-page-nav flows
  (AJAX fires `submit` before the server confirms and may still fail).
- **Never auto-submit.** Only fill and report.
- **Closing the review modal must never destroy it.** `onClose` minimizes to the
  pill (`FillerModal.minimize`); destroying it left "Reset & Re-run" as the only
  way back, which wipes every field just filled.
- **On touch the picker only commits via Confirm.** A finger has no hover state,
  so a plain `click` handler commits whatever it happened to land on; `picker.ts`
  branches on `pointerType`. Mouse still commits on click.
- Field matching normalizes attributes with diacritics stripped, so "Résumé"
  matches "resume" (`normalizeAttr` in `src/shared/fieldKeys.ts`).
- **Playwright must use `channel: 'chromium'`** — the headless shell can't load
  extensions. `worker.url()` is a method, not a property.

## Testing conventions

TDD: for pure/testable logic (parsers, matchers, selector generators,
heuristics, storage codecs) write the failing Vitest test first, then implement.
Vitest runs under jsdom with a small `chrome.*` mock in `test/setup.ts`.
`*.test.ts` files sit next to the code they cover in `src/shared` and
`src/content`. The hard fixture sites (`test/fixtures/sites/`, configs in
`test-site-configs.json`) mirror real-world pain and are the E2E confidence
signal — keep them green. The redirect fixtures rely on `localhost` vs
`127.0.0.1` being different hosts on the same fixture server, which is what makes
the cross-origin handoff real in E2E.
